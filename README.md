# React Native AsyncStorage Intermittent Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native.  The `AsyncStorage.getItem` method intermittently returns null, even when the requested key exists in storage. This behavior is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably. 

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that `AsyncStorage.getItem` returns null even when a key is known to have data stored. This problem appears randomly and doesn't show a consistent pattern related to device, OS, or data size. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
3. Observe the intermittent data retrieval failures. Note that these failures are not guaranteed to occur on every run, but are sufficiently frequent to indicate a problem.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file implements a more robust approach to data retrieval using a combination of error handling and a retry mechanism.  This reduces the likelihood of null returns and provides a better user experience.
